            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>The RefugEAP Network's overarching objective is to facilitate the development and implementation of
                'pathway to Higher Education' English language provision for refugee-background students (RBS), with a
                particular focus on English for Academic Purposes (EAP).</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Why is this work needed?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>In marked contrast to the ESOL classroom, the EAP classroom has not traditionally been a space which is
                open and accessible to refugee-background students (RBSs). This is due to the presence of a variety of
                systemic barriers, reflecting those associated with difficulties that refugees face in accessing HE in
                general, which includes that of the prohibitive cost of programmes of study. While ESOL provision is
                widely and freely available for these students, EAP provision is typically not, and the importance of
                EAP has been outlined by Jacqueline Stevenson and Sally Baker in their book Refugees in Higher
                Education: Debates, Discourse and Practice as follows:
                <q>What those seeking access to HE need is English for Academic Purposes which enables learners to develop
                those sorts of English language skills needed for higher level academic and vocational courses</q>
                Although free places on the latter have gradually been growing across the sector, the need still by far
                outstrips demand, and there is still much work to be done to increase the numbers of EAP opportunities
                open to refugee background students wishing to access HE.

                        <p>The RefugEAP Network Working Group is working to redress this situation. It consists of a small group of
                            EAP practitioners, researchers and managers from across the UK HE sector working together to develop and
                            run the RefugEAP Network. This working group, which is a branch of the BALEAP EAP for Social Justice
                            Special Interest Group, was established in April 2022.</p></td>

            <br>
            <div id="divblock">
                <p>The RefugEAP Network has been set up:
                    <br><br>
                    1. to connect and support individuals and institutions from across the UK HE sector who are keen to take
                    this work forward
                    <br>
                    2. to gather and share examples of good practice and impact in order to:
                    <br>a. provide evidence of successful sanctuary initiatives related to facilitating access to EAP to
                    allow individuals/organisations to build strong cases for the development of similar initiatives within
                    their institutions;
                    <br>b. provide ideas, strategies and resources to those developing and engaging in sanctuary initiatives

                    <br>3. to advocate for increased opportunities across the HE sector for RBSs to access pre-sessional EAP
                    provision (or similar) and successfully move onto degree programmes

                    <br>4. to create new sector-wide systems, where necessary, to optimise communication flow between all
                    stakeholders (including universities, RBSs, potential partner organisations) in order to match
                    opportunities to needs
